        ## How to Use This Application

        This application allows you to analyse drillhole data through various plots and analyses. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use it:

        1. **Upload Data**: Use the sidebar to upload your drillhole data file. The file should be in CSV format.
        2. **Filter Data**: Select the variables you want to filter on and apply the desired filters. This will be used in all subsequent analyses.
        3. **Select Analysis**: Choose the type of analysis you want to perform:
            - **Downhole Line Plot**: Visualize the data along/down the drillhole.
            - **Interval Variability Analysis**: Analyse the variability of intervals with respect to different parameters (e.g., lithology and alteration types).
            - **Scatter Analysis**: Create scatter plots to visualize relationships between variables.
            - **Box Plot**: Create box plots to visualize the distribution of variables.
        4. **Sample Selection Assistant**: Use this tool to assist in selecting samples based on various criteria (e.g., mass requirements and cut off grade).

        ## What This Application Can Do

        - Load and display drillhole data from a CSV file.
        - Filter data based on user-selected criteria.
        - Generate downhole line plots, scatter plots, and box plots.
        - Perform interval variability analysis.
        - Assist in sample selection based on user-defined parameters.

        ## What This Application Can't Do

        - Handle non-CSV file formats.
        - Automatically detect and correct data quality issues.
        - Perform advanced statistical analyses beyond the provided plots and analyses.

        ## Potential Issues and How to Avoid Them

        - **File Upload Issues**: Ensure the file is in CSV format and encoded in UTF-8, Latin-1, or ISO-8859-1.
        - **Data Quality**: Ensure the data is clean and properly formatted. Missing or non-numeric values in critical columns can cause errors.
        - **Filter Selection**: Be cautious when applying multiple filters, as overly restrictive filters may result in no data being displayed.

        If you encounter any issues, please refer to the error log for more details.
